# GETNS Afterschool ECA Website

My goal is to create a simple, static website providing parents with clear, accessible information about the Extra-Curricular Activities (ECA) program at Glasnevin Educate Together National School. It includes a detailed class timetable, policies, and a streamlined application process to improve communication and engagement with the school community.

---

## 🌟 Project Overview

This project aims to improve the way ECA information is presented and accessed by parents. By centralizing all essential afterschool activity information in one place, the site simplifies how parents explore class options and apply for them.

The site is built using custom HTML5 and CSS3 (with Bootstrap for layout). It is designed to be fully responsive and easy to navigate for all users on all device types.

## 🎯 Key Goals of website

- **Improve Accessibility**: Make it easy for parents to view all available ECA classes.
- **Facilitate Enrollment**: Provide a clear and simple way to express interest or apply for classes without contacting each teacher individually
- **Reduce Admin Load**: Allow the ECA committee to direct parents to the site instead of repeating information.
- **Ensure Transparency**: Clearly outline policies and processes for participation.

## 👥 Target Audience

- **Primary Audience**: Parents/guardians of children attending GETNS who are interested in afterschool classes.
- **Secondary Audience**: Committee members and organizers of the ECA program.
