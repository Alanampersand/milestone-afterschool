Project:

Project purpose: Presentation of static data
In this project, you’ll build a static front-end site to present useful information to users, using all the technologies that you have learned about so far.
Value provided:
Data is presented in a way that helps users achieve their goals, e.g. learning about a product/service that they are interested in.
The presentation of this data advances the site owner's goals, e.g. helps them market a product/service.


Project Requirements
Main Technologies
Required: HTML, CSS
Optional: Bootstrap and/or other CSS libraries/frameworks.
Mandatory Requirements
A project violating any of these requirements will FAIL
Static front end project: Write custom HTML5 and CSS3 code to create a website of at least 3 pages, or (if using a single scrolling page), at least 3 separate page areas.
Information Architecture: Incorporate a main navigation menu and structured layout (you might want to use Bootstrap to accomplish this).
Documentation: Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the value that it provides to its users.
Version Control: Use Git & GitHub for version control.
Attribution: Maintain clear separation between code written by you and code from external sources (e.g. libraries or tutorials). Attribute any code from external sources to its source via comments above the code and (for larger dependencies) in the README.
Deployment: Deploy the final version of your code to a hosting platform such as GitHub Pages.

 Project Ideas
You can either choose to build the website using your own idea, or take inspiration from the example ideas below.
When choosing a milestone project, it is best practice to choose a new topic. The reason for this is to avoid duplicating your HTML/CSS code as it can only be graded once. If you resubmit part of a previous project, you cannot receive marks for this. For this reason, we strongly recommend that you create 4 different projects using the ideas provided. Furthermore, you want to display a diverse portfolio to prospective employers. In a small number of cases, if your reason for completing the course is to develop a business idea, you may want to create a single project. If you do want to build on the same project idea in Interactive as in User-Centric, then we would recommend submitting different sections of the project for each assessment. For example, a travel website at User-Centric might require a Home, Gallery and About page. Then at Interactive, you could submit a Contact and Location map page. For Data-Centric, you could submit a restaurant menu and special diet requests. Finally, for Full-Stack, you could combine everything into the Django framework with payments. As this is not the recommended approach, please do not proceed in this way before discussing your intention with your asessor.


Project Idea 0
Bring your own idea(s) to life, based on providing value to users to address a specific real or imagined need.


Project Example Idea 1
Build a website for a band (real or fictional)
 External user’s goal:
The site's users are fans and potential fans who wish to learn more about the band's history and the band members, and possibly book them for shows.

The band are interested in selling more of their music/merchandise and getting more gigs.
Potential features to include:
Showcase photos, audio and/or video clips from the band's catalog.
Publicise the band's upcoming shows and/or availability to perform at events such as weddings and corporate parties.
Provide links to external resources, such as the band's social media profiles (can point anywhere at all).


Project Example Idea 2
Build a website for a gym
External user’s goal:
 The site's users are gym members and potential members, who want to know more about the gym and its procedures.
Site owner's goal:
The gym is interested in attracting and retaining members.
Potential features to include:
 Showcase photos of people having fun exercising in the gym and any other media to motivate people to come.
 Provide detail on the organised classes in the gym and their schedule.
 Provide information on the gym's location, opening hours, contact details and any external resources.


Project Example Idea 3
Build a personal portfolio site (potentially for yourself).
 External user’s goal:
The site's users are recruiters considering to hire the applicant.
Site owner's goal:
Present self in best light and get hired.
Potential features to include:
Tell about educational history and work experience.
Tell about skills and any other relevant competencies and interests.
Provide basic personal information and contact information for recruiters.
Advanced potential feature (nice-to-have)
Showcase portfolio of projects so far (in-lieu of links to real projects that you'd build later, feel free to include links to fake projects or random sites on the internet at this stage)

My Idea:

Afterschool Activity menu and request form

Timetable of all classes
Details about classes (page for each class)
Form for submitting interest in form

Key Business Goal:

Presenting info about available ECA classes and facilitating applications

Audience:

Parents of children in GETNS ECA Class

[TODO] Considerations

What are the Business Goals
What could be the Call to Aciton?
Who are the users?
What are the Users’ Needs?

User Story:

As a parent, I want to see what classes are available for each term for my child based on their age group, and I want to be able to enroll them in that class easily. 


Use GitHub to plan and track the project (tomorrow)
